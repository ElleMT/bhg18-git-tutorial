# BHG18 Montreal Collaborative git/GitHub Tutorial

## Terminology
* FORK: make a copy of the GIT repository
* CLONE: download the contents of your fork onto your computer
* PULL REQUEST: submit a committed staged change to your remote fork
* BRANCH: a copy of your fork on which you perform changes.

## GitHub collaborative workflow
1. Always **fork** a project you want to work on, so you can have your own copy of the original repository. Do this by going to the repository on GitHub and clicking *Fork* in the top-right corner.
2. Making sure you have git installed on your computer, open a terminal and type: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reponame`. A new directory will be created titled `yourreponame`.
3. Open [Atom](https://atom.io/), a text editor with git/GitHub integration
4. In Atom, click **File --> Add a project folder** and select the folder you just downloaded.
