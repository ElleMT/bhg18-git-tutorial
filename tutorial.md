# GITHUB COLLABORATIVE TUTORIAL

*Here's a list of GitHub-related words we learned today*
1. Always **fork** a project you want to work on, so you can have your own copy of the original repository.
2. Open a terminal and type: `git clone https://GitHub.com/linkofyourrepo`
3. Open **Atom**
4. In Atom, **Add a project folder** and select the folder you just downloaded.
